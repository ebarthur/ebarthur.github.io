_I wish I had the right words to mumble it out._

I'm deeply grateful to God for the immense opportunities He’s brought my way, and for the brilliant, uplifting people He’s placed in it.

## Topboy

I appreciate your efforts. What might have felt like simply posting your work on Twitter ended up inspiring me to get up and start coding. My career hasn't even begun, but I want to thank you for always being responsive and open. You've allowed many of us to learn from your journey, and I’m incredibly grateful.
Thank you, [NK](https://x.com/topboyasante).

## Degreat

I don't think I have enough words for you, sir. Everything I do today is **heavily inspired** by your art and your relentless drive to grow and excel. I truly hope I'm not the only one you've blessed with your knowledge and skill, because people really do need a _Degreat_ in their lives.

One day, I might find all the right words to express how much it means. Until then, God bless you, [GR](https://x.com/_yogr).

## Winma

Of course, you. Thank you for being my biggest support and my favorite person through it all. I couldn’t have done this without you.
## Tout le monde

To everyone who has ever guided me in one way or another: your appreciation is coming. For now, just know that I’m thankful. Truly, deeply thankful.
